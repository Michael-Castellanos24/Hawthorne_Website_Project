<!-- Historical Fact 1 -->
<div id="hist1">
<h2 id="historyfact1">The Origin of Hawthorne</h2>
<p>Hawthorne was first inhabited by the Lenni-Lenape Indians, which were also known as the Delaware. The area
of present day Hawthorne was first settled in the 1700s by Dutch immigrants who were to become the borough's 
pioneer farmers. When the area was founded, the original name was Manchester township, which included the 
area of Hawthorne, and other neighboring towns. Hawthorne was encorperated when the township separated up into 
several smaller towns.</p>

<h3>Additional Facts</h3>

<ul>
	<li>There is evidence that Major General Lafayette was encamped here during the Revolutionary War. </li>
	<li>Other towns that got separated include present day North Haledon and the first ward of Paterson</li>
	<li>Hawthorne was originally a farmland community when first founded</li>
</ul>

</div>

<!-- Historical Fact 2 -->
<div id="hist2">
<h2 id="historyfact2">Town Incorperation</h2>
<p>Hawthorne was officially incorperated into a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 24, 
1898. There isn't any clear historical evidence on how "Hawthorne" got it's name. One theory is that the 
town was named after the author Nathaniel Hawthorne. The other is that it was derived from the hawthorn bush,
which was vegitation that had to be cleared away from the cow pastures from when the town was a farming
community. Dr. Sylvester Utter was elected the first mayor of the new town.  Around 1908, a house building 
program began that developed Hawthorne into a suburban community.</p>
<h3>Additional Facts</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Two streets in Hawthorne today are named after Dr. Sylvester Utter.</li>
	<li>In Hawthorne's early years, the town was marked by an atmosphere of inexperience and indecisiveness.</li>
	<li>The earliest homestead in Hawthorne is said to have been built in 1730.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<!-- Historical Fact 3 -->
<div id="hist3">
<h2 id="historyfact3">Hawthorne's Involvement in the Revolutionary War</h2>
<p>Hawthorne also has some history involving the Revolutionary War. One of the oldest houses in Hawthorne,
was constucted by John Francis Ryerson. He lived in his house up until the start of the Revolutionary War,
when it was found out that he was loyal to England in the war. Because of this, Ryerson was confiscated out
of his home. In 1780, troops of the American Army were spread out throughout Passaic County. During October 
and November, General Lafayette and his light infantry troops were stationed in what was then called Wagaraw,
and is now part of Hawthorne. During the encampment, Lafayette made his headquarters in a tent outside of the 
John Francis Ryerson house. He and his troops stayed at the home until October 23rd, when Lafayette moved his
troops to Cranetown (modern day Montclair). Their plan was that they were supposed to make an attack on British
troops on Staten Island, but this attack never happened due to the boats they were supposed to take never arriving.</p>
<h3>Additional Facts</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Lafayette has a street named after him in Hawthorne, and is the main road linking north and south.</li>
	<li>The Lafayette Headquarters is still in it's original location from when it was first built</li>
	<li>The building is now occupied by the Bottagra Restaurant</li>
</ul>

<!-- Historical Fact 4 -->

<div id="hist4">
<h2 id="historyfact4">Hawthorne's Railroad History</h2>
<p>Hawthorne has some railroad history too, with two railroad lines passing through town, owned and operated
by two different railroads with two different stations. The Paterson and Ramapo Railroad built their railroad
linking Hoboken and Upstate New York. Hawthorne station opened in 1848. The station was taken over by the Erie
Railroad and became part of their main line from Hoboken to Chicago. The Erie Railroad later rebuilt the station
in 1949 further north to remove a nearby grade crossing, with the new station officially opening in 1950.  
The New York Susquehanna and Western Railroad constructed their railroad through the center of town, with a 
station in downtown Hawthorne opening in 1872, with passenger services running between Pavonia and Butler. 
Unfortunitly, the station was closed to passengers in 1966, when the NYS&W offically discontinued passenger
operations. Today, the station building still stands, and the railroad still operates with freight trains only.
As for the Main Line Hawthorne station, it was taken over when the Erie and Lackawanna Railroads merged in 1960,
being owned by the new Erie Lackawanna Railroad. Today, New Jersey Transit owns the station, with passenger 
services between Hoboken and Suffern, NY still operating daily.</p>
<h3>Additional Facts</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The NYS&W station building was moved 75ft. in 2010 to reduce truck collisions with the building roof</li>
	<li>The NYS&W station is a stopping point for the annual "Toys for Tots" train to pick up Christmas presents</li>
	<li>One of the Main Line station's former names was Norwood, but was changed due to a town in Bergen County also being called Norwood</li>
